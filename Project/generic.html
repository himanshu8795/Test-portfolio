								<h2>Project YreX</h2>
								<p>To identify need , is the most important part of software Analysis and so for us too .</br> To identify needs we should have known about the Project Title ,” Media Sharing & Chatting Application “ .Title tells us that it is an application for media sharing and chatting .</br> So the needs found to be are :</br>
									1.	To develop a single application performing two tasks .</br>
									2.	To develop an application which can perform Chatting and Media Sharing both simultaneously .</br>
									3.	To develop an application which doesn't use Mobile Data or can say Internet .</br>
									4.	To develop an application which is fast enough to save time .</br>
									5.	To develop an application which can share any media.</br> 
									6.	To develop an application which uses less resources and should be lightweight.</br>
									</h2>
								<p>Preliminary Investigation plays an important role in Software Analysis as to know the problems and deficiency of previous or existing applications makes it easier to develop a new application .</br> So the Investigation done are :</br>
									1.	There are many chatting applications which work on the Internet or require Mobile Data to transfer messages .</br>
									2.	There are many media sharing applications that also require the Internet and many of those don’t . For this , those applications first upload media to their servers and then send it to client or user .</br>
									3.	Uploading and downloading wastes too much time .</br>
									4.	Both chatting and media sharing in a single application is not seen yet .</br>
									5.	Speed and accuracy is lacking in existing applications .</br>
								</br>
									So , from the above reasons and statements we can get the need to develop our Application .
